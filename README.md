# Geospatial Data Visualization

This repository contains several portfolios created for personal documentation, self-taught learning and demo purpose, presented in **R Markdown** and **Jupyter Notebook**. Additional portfolio(s) will be added later once it is available.

## Contents

* **R**
  * [The deepest point in the Bay of Biscay](https://rpubs.com/raynaldiprtm/geo-datavis-15): A static map showing the Bay of Biscay location in the North of Spain, including the deepest point within this area with its transect plots depicting the ocean depth cross-section visualization. *Tools:* `rnaturalearth` `rnaturalearthdata` `ggplot2` `ggspatial` `rgdal` `marmap`
  * [Map of New Zealand](https://rpubs.com/raynaldiprtm/geo-datavis-19): Geographical information, i.e., land area, population, sex ratio, and the country's median income, presented in several plots. *Tools:* `dplyr` `sf` `raster` `spData` `tmap` `grid`
  * [Charging stations in Boston](https://rpubs.com/raynaldiprtm/geo-datavis-20): Interactive maps showing the location of several charging stations with a specific EV connector type in Boston. *Tools:* `dplyr` `leaflet` `magrittr`
