This repository contains several portfolios created for personal documentation and demo purpose as part of a self-taught data science learning journey, presented in **R Markdown** documents or **Jupyter Notebooks**. The regular update for this repository is not part of the current plan.

More portfolio prepared in **R Markdown** can be accessed through this [link](https://rpubs.com/raynaldiprtm).
